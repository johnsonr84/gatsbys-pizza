## Usage

- In order to use this APP, you need terminal (mac: pre-installed) or gitbash (pc: must be installed). You also need to download and install node.js and npm or yarn package manager. Open the cloned REPO in your favorite code editor, and then in terminal, enter the command “npm i“ or “yarn add” to install the dependencies in both gatsby and sanity folders. Now you are ready to start using the app by entering “npm start” or "yarn start" on your terminal or gitbash in both gatsby and sanity folder. It's recommended to have two terminal windows going at the same time. One for your server side folder (sanity) and the other for your client facing folder (gatsby). If you just want to try how the app works, you can go to the link [here](https://gatsbys-pizza.netlify.app/)
